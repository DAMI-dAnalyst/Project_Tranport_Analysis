## Key Features and Analysis
1. Ride Categorization
We engineered features to classify rides into various categories, such as:

Ride Category: Distinguishing between free rides and paying rides based on ride duration.
Ride Time Category: Identifying rides during peak and off-peak hours.
Ride Day Category: Categorizing rides based on whether they occurred on weekends or weekdays.

## General EDA Questions Addressed
We explored and visualized various aspects of the data, addressing the following questions:

What is the proportion of rides made by members compared to casual users?
