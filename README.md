# Exploratory Data Analysis of Divvy Bike Using Python
## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the Divvy Bike-Share dataset to uncover insights into user behaviors, temporal dynamics, and spatial patterns. By transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Divvy Bike-Share system for the year 2023. You can access the dataset from the following link https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

## Key Features and Analysis
1. Ride Categorization
We engineered features to classify rides into various categories, such as:

Ride Category: Distinguishing between free rides and paying rides based on ride duration.
Ride Time Category: Identifying rides during peak and off-peak hours.
Ride Day Category: Categorizing rides based on whether they occurred on weekends or weekdays.

## General EDA Questions Addressed
We explored and visualized various aspects of the data, addressing the following questions:

What is the proportion of rides made by members compared to casual users?
. Which start station has the highest average ride duration?
. How do the proportions of free and paying rides change during different days of the week?
. Visualization of ride frequencies during peak and off-peak times for member and casual riders.
. Visualization of ride start times on weekends and weekdays.
. Visualization of the number of trips by month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
. Analysis of the relationship between time of day and distance of trips.

## Results and Insights
The exploratory analysis has revealed significant insights into user behavior, ride patterns, and spatial dynamics within the Divvy Bike-Share system. 

## Conclusion
This EDA serves as a critical step in understanding the Divvy Bike-Share data and preparing it for subsequent machine learning tasks. I have laid the groundwork for generating actionable business intelligence that can inform strategic decisions for the Divvy Bike-Share system.
